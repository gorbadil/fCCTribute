          Charles Michael "Chuck" Palahniuk" born February 21, 1962) is an
          American novelist who describes his work as transgressional fiction.
          He has published 19 novels, three nonfiction books, two graphic
          novels, and two adult coloring books, as well as several short
          stories. His first published novel was Fight Club, which was adapted
          into a film of the same title.

            <h4>Early Career</h4>
            <p>
              He wrote for the local newspaper for a short while but then began
              working for Freightliner Trucks as a diesel mechanic, continuing
              until his writing career took off. During that time, he wrote
              manuals on fixing trucks and had a stint as a journalist, a job to
              which he did not return until after he became a successful
              novelist. After casually attending a seminar by Landmark
              Education, Palahniuk quit his job as a journalist in 1988. He
              performed volunteer work for a homeless shelter and volunteered at
              a hospice as an escort, providing transportation for terminally
              ill people, taking them to support group meetings. He ceased
              volunteering upon the death of a patient to whom he had grown
              attached.

            <h4>Fight Club</h4>
            <p>
              After his first novel, Invisible Monsters, was rejected by all
              publishers he submitted it to, he began work on his first
              published novel, Fight Club.[12] Palahniuk wrote this story in his
              spare time while working for Freightliner. After initially
              publishing it as a short story (which became chapter 6 of the
              novel) in the 1995 compilation Pursuit of Happiness, Palahniuk
              expanded it into a full novel, which, contrary to his
              expectations, a publisher accepted.[13] While the original
              hardcover edition of the book received positive reviews and some
              awards, it had a short shelf life.
